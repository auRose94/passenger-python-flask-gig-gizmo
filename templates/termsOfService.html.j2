  www.GigGizmo.com (the “Site”), though we will notify you of any
  changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact these Terms
  of Service. Continued use of the Services after any such changes
  have been made shall constitute your consent to such changes. If a
  change has a material adverse impact on you, and you have contracted
  and prepaid for a certain term, you may notify us within 30 days
  after being informed of that change that you do not agree with the
  change. If you do so, we will delay applying the change to you until
  your prepaid term ends, or, at our sole and absolute discretion,
  allow you to cancel your account, and we will refund any prepaid
  amount pro rata to you. If you use our Services after your prepaid
  term ends, all changes will apply to you. You are responsible for

      </li>
      <li>
        you acknowledge that the Beta Services are not at the level of
        performance or compatibility of a final, generally available
        product offering, and may be substantially modified prior to
        commercial availability, or withdrawn. We are under no obligation
        to provide technical support with regards to the Beta Services,
        and we provide no assurance that any specific errors or
        performance issues in the Beta Services will be corrected; and
      </li>
      <li>
        the Beta Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available”
        basis without any warranties or conditions of any kind, whether
        express, implied, statutory or otherwise. Use of the Beta
        Services is at your sole risk. In no event will we be liable to

        inability to use the Beta Services.

      <li>
        GigGizmo™ Services. As between you and GigGizmo™, GigGizmo™
        retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Services.
        Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict, impair, encumber,
        alter, deprive, or adversely affect the Services or any of
        GigGizmo™’s rights or interests therein or any other GigGizmo™
        intellectual property, brands, information, content, processes,

        tangible or intangible. All rights, title, and interest in and to
        the Services not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved
        by GigGizmo™. You may from time to time provide suggestions,
        comments or other feedback to GigGizmo™ with respect to the
        Services (“Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as
        confidential by you, shall not create any confidentiality
        obligation for GigGizmo™ notwithstanding anything else. You
        shall, and hereby do, grant to GigGizmo™ a non-exclusive,
        worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable,
        royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use and exploit the
        Feedback for any purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        Customer Content. You grant GigGizmo™ a limited, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as set forth in Section
        9.1) license, without a right of sublicense, to access, use,
        reproduce, electronically distribute, transmit, perform, format,
        display, store, archive, and index the Customer Content for the
        purpose of supporting your use of the Services and providing
        Services to you. GigGizmo™ may also use Customer Content for the
        purpose of supporting and developing the Services, provided that
        when doing so, GigGizmo™ shall only use Customer Content in an
        anonymized and aggregated way. Subject only to the limited
        license expressly granted herein, you and your Authorized Users
        shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer
        Content and all intellectual property rights therein. Nothing in
        this Agreement will confer on GigGizmo™ any right of ownership or
        interest in the Customer Content or the intellectual property
        rights there
      </li>
      <li>
        Responsibility for Customer Content and Mentions. You are solely
        responsible for the Customer Content that you or Authorized Users
        upload, publish, display, link to, or otherwise make available
        via the Services, and you agree that GigGizmo™ is only acting as
        a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of
        the Customer Content and the online display of Queries and
        Mentions. GigGizmo™ will not review, share, distribute, or
        reference any Customer Content or Mentions except as provided
        herein, as provided in GigGizmo™’s privacy policy and copyright
        policy, or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, GigGizmo™ retains the authority to remove any Customer
        Content uploaded that it deems in violation of this Agreement, at
        its sole discretion.

        Purchases By Authorization Form. If an Authorization Form is
        issued for the purchase of Services, you agree to pay all fees as
        and when described per the Authorization Form(s). GigGizmo™ shall
        invoice you for the fees in the currency set forth on the
        applicable Authorization Form. Unless otherwise stated on the
        Authorization Form, all invoices shall be payable within 30 days
        of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts shall not affect
        payment of non-disputed amounts. You shall make payments to the
        entity and address set forth in the invoice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Online Paid Services. For paid Services purchased online (“Online
        Services”), you must provide GigGizmo™ with a PayPal account to
        pay for such services. Some Services can be purchased as a
        monthly or yearly subscription. You agree that GigGizmo™ has
        permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and
        payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms
        GigGizmo™ retains in the future) your submitted payment
        information in order to process your purchase. Depending on where
        you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where
        your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be
        subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices,
        including because of exchange rates. GigGizmo™ does not support
        all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. If the
        payment method you use with us, reaches its expiration date and
        you do not edit your payment method information or cancel, you
        authorize GigGizmo™ to continue billing your credit card and/or
        PayPal account and you remain responsible for any uncollected
        amounts. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing
        information you provide us at the time of purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Free Trial Period. If you sign up for a free trial period for a
        Service that is subject to charges (the “Free Trial”), we may
        require you to provide us with a valid payment method; PayPal. We
        may start charging you automatically on the first day after the
        Free Trial is over, unless you cancel before the end of the Free
        Trial period. The Free Trial is only available to first time
        users of a paid Online Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Subscription Services; Auto-renewal and Cancellation. If you are
        purchasing Online Services on a subscription basis, you may have
        the option to purchase a monthly or a yearly subscription, which
        will automatically renew at the end of its applicable term.
        Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis
        (as per the option chosen when you purchased such Online
        Services) and are non-refundable for the subscription period they
        are purchased for. You agree that GigGizmo™ may process your
        payment with PayPal on each monthly, annual, or other renewal
        term (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day
        corresponding to the first day you subscribed to Online Services.
        If your paid subscription to Online Services began on a day not
        contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on
        January 30 and there is no February 30), we will process your
        payment on the last day of such month. You may elect to cancel or
        downgrade your Online Services at any time by following the steps
        outlined here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Late Payment. If any amounts due hereunder are not received by
        GigGizmo™ by the due date, then at GigGizmo™’s discretion, such
        charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or
        the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the
        date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon
        10 days’ written notice, GigGizmo™ may suspend your access to the
        Services if GigGizmo™ does not receive the amounts invoiced
        hereunder at the expiration of such period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taxes and Withholdings. You are responsible for paying all Taxes
        associated with your purchase of Services. If GigGizmo™ has the
        legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are
        responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be
        invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide GigGizmo™ with a
        valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
        taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the
        compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and
        clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If
        you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such
        payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
        that, after making all required deductions or withholdings,
        GigGizmo™ receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
        received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
